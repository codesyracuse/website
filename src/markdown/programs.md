### Grants
#### Case Studies
**South Side Stand**  
The South Side Stand is getting a new website thanks to the collaborative efforts of Syracusans who are invested in the city. With guidance from Ashley, Adam Peruta’s interactive design students spent their Fall 2019 semester re-designing The Stand’s website. From there Ben volunteered to mentor Dana McMullen through the process of turning those designs into a functioning website. Thanks to a grant, The Stand is able to pay Dana for her efforts. 

**Onondaga County Library Class**  
Autumn 2019 marked the third year of the on-going collaboration between the professional software engineers of Syracuse and the local library. This year saw children from the North Side participating in a weekly after school program taught by Allyson. She led the children through code.org educational software engineering activities. With logistical and financial backing from Density and Commonspace, the class was able to provide hot food and cold beverages to the children and, for the child who attended the most and did the best, an iPad. Dragana coordinated the library’s resources to ensure each child in attendance had a laptop as well as a space to learn.
