  ## Join the CODES Mentorship Program

  This is about the improvement of skills as a developer or software engineer. Less like job training and more like gym training. Everyone wants to make progress, and there is only one way to do it: put in your reps. 


  * We help match mentors with trainees.
  * Aim for 30 minute weekly or biweekly meetings, virtual or in-person. 
  * We expect an initial 6-week commitment that can be extended.
  * But you are under no obligation to continue with a specific person if it's not working out.

### For Mentors   

  When you fill out the mentor form, we make a match with a trainee based on your skills and experience. Whether you have two years of experience, or twenty, you just have to know more than your trainee. You also must be 18 or older.
